      <description>An company is wanting in measuring the degree of satisfaction on their customers in order to improve the quality of service provision and sales in general.
The Public Relations department team has collected an extensive data on their customers such as products reviews. Based on the reviews in format text, the team would like to predict whether their customers are satisfied with the product or not.
Natural language processing can be used to build predictive models to perform sentiment analysis on social media posts and reviews and predict if customers are happy or not.</description>
